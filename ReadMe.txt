Use 3 ways to implement a 16 by 16 sudoku solver. 
The first is the Naive way based on backtracking. 
The second is implementing Constraint satisfaction problem methods including Constraint Propagation, Most Constraining Variable, Least Restricting Value, early termination, etc to improve the backtracking. 
The final way is based on dancing links and it's the fastest method.
